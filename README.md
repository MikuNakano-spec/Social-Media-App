This my social media project that was base on Coding in flow but i add and change alot of stuff.

To start first install all the package with npm i --legacy-peer-deps

and run with npm run dev

The ChatAI feature i was using a local AI "ollama" to run cause it a school project and i don't want to use pay AI. You can use whatever you want
